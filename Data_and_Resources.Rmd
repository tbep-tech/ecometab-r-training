# Data and Resources

This page contains links to the data we're using in our workshop, and a sample of a few useful resources online and in print. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but hopefully a launching pad for useful website and books. All of these examples provide code in same shape or form.

### Datasets

This is a list of the data sources used in this workshop. For live-coding, please refer to this [**link**](https://tinyurl.com/live-ecometab){target="_blank"}, which will update everytime we save a file. That means you can refresh the page to see whatever code we are typing, and download this file at anytime.

 - Full Dataset as a [zipped folder](data/779980.zip). Inside you'll find several SWMP files from Apalachicola and Sapelo Island NERRS, as downloaded from the CDMO zipped downloads feature of the advanced query system ([here](http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/aqs/zips.cfm)).
 
 - All R scripts used in the lessons as a [zipped folder](scripts.zip).  Inside you'll find these files: 
    - [R_Basics.R](rbasics.R)
    - [detiding.R](detiding.R)
    - [odum.R](odum.R)
    - [using.R](using.R)
