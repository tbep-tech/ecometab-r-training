# NERRS Ecosystem Metabolism R Training

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. R has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This training workshop will provide attendees with the foundation for using R to calculate and interpret ecosystem metabolism with NERRS data. 

## Course objectives

This course is designed to expose you to the fundamentals of using R for estimating ecosystem metabolism wiht NERRS data.  A specific focus will be on using monitoring data from the [NERRS CDMO](https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/) with functions from the [SWMPr]() and [WtRegDO]() packages.  SWMPr provides simple functions to retrieve, organize, and analyze SWMP data and WtRegDO provides the functions for estimating metabolism.  You will not be experts by the end of the course, but you will have a solid foundation for continued learning.  By the end of this course you will be able to or have the resources to find out how to:

* Use R to import and organize SWMP data
* Use the WtRegDO package to detide dissolved oxygen time series
* Use the WtRegOD package to estimate ecosystem metabolism using the Odum open water method
* Use R to understand and interpret ecosystem metabolism
